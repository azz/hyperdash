> Dashboard for Hyperlinks

WIP.

Idea is to have two YAML files (currently in the `/data` directory of this repository but they will eventually be external) that power a dashboard of URLs. Like a souped up bookmarks bar, but with tagging, filtering, and favouriting.

Static site built with Gatsby.

Demo deploys to https://hyperdash.netlify.com
