> Dashboard for Hyperlinks

WIP.

Idea is to have two YAML files (current in this repository but they should be external) that power a dashboard of URLs. Like a souped up bookmarks bar, but with tagging, filtering, and favouriting.

Static site built with Gatsby.

Demo deploys to https://hyperdash.netlify.com
